              <p>Welcome to my visual art portfolio!<br>
              I made this portfolio as a learning experience (or perhaps a diary) for my artistic repertoire.
              For years, I have not only grown in my art skills, but also with who I am as a person.
              Making art has allowed me to personally connect with myself as well as explore my curiosity with the world around me. Art has always been a language I'm fluent in since I was a kid.
              And sharing that with people is one of the most beneficial and wonderful things I get to do in life. I will not only explain
              the creative process behind the works that I'm proud of, but also on how they reflect who I am.</p>

              <p>
                For fun, I explored color theory and the seven elements of art and design (line, shape, form, space, value, color and texture).
                And I played around with those ideas since. Before I became obsessed with portrait art and painting, I was creating art with nothing but colored pencils,
                markers, pens, and a pencil.
              <br>
              <br>
                As a kid, I was fascinated with everything from the animated energy of cartoon shows
                to the iconic gaming world of Pokemon and Mario games. You can probably imagine I was a cartoon and game junkee at the time. I live and breathe the junkee life.
                Looking back throughout the years, I have realized how much innocence and carefree-ness I had back then was reflected in my art.
                Not only that, but I was also fascinated with geometry and color. The form, the composition, the saturation of colors, how the lines and color play off of each other.
                I studied some artists like Andy Warhol, MC Escher, and Kandinsky. There was just something about their work that captivates the eye.
                They don't just plop a bunch of shapes and colors onto a medium. They create a whole 'nother world that's almost abstract, yet otherworldly.
                Sometimes I dream about living inside their paintings. Even when I was such a video game and cartoon addict, I've always wondered what it would
                be like to live inside their universe.
                <br>
                <br>
                My childhood self hated the superficial unglamorous-ness of the real world (and it still applies).
                My mindset when making art was always "Why not make another universe to live in?"
                So my abstract art is not only something experimental and worth developing, but also, in a way, an escape from reality.</p>
