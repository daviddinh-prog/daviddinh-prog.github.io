<!--The page must include these HTML tags:
headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.),
paragraph <p>,
<div>,
<span>,
<strong>,
<em>,
<table>,
lists (<ol> and <ul>),
and image <img>
Refer to the Sample HTML Page (Links to an external site.) for examples.
Do this in iterations, where each student must contribute something that includes:
A comment with purpose of new code and mention of the source or inspiration for added code, and the actual new code.
Edited code should also be commented on to detail changes.
Then the group commits the changes and pushes them to GitHub with proper commit comments.-->
