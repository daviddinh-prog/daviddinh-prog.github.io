    <p>I'm the kind of guy that likes to draw, play music, and hang out with my cat.<br>
    During quarantine, I did pretty much all of those things. When I was still at school, I<br>
    never had enough time in the day to draw or play music. For the past two months, I was able<br>
    to make my time for myself while also managing to juggle schoolwork on the side.</p>
